<h1>Concordion Snippet Utility Class</h1>
<p>
This class can be used via Concordion fixtures to include parts from the source code of the fixture into the concordion test page
during test execution. This can be handy when the concordion test is the actual documentation of some library. You can import source lines
that are between
<pre>
SNIPPET START: name
</pre>

and 
<pre>
SNIPPET END: name
</pre>

lines. This page was also created this way.
</p>
<p>
To use the utility the test fixture class should be embedded as the following:
</p>
	<pre>
<span ext:embed="snippet(&quot;classAnnotations&quot;)" />
    </pre>
    
Yes, this code was embedded to he HTML page using the concordion <tt>embed</tt> extension and the <tt>snippet</tt> class.
It is recommended that the fixture class declares a field to hold a <tt>Snippet</tt> object:

	<pre>
<span ext:embed="snippet(&quot;snippetField&quot;)" />
    </pre>

and since Concordion can invoke methods only from the fixture you also have to define a method that delegates to the <tt>Snippet</tt>
object the task to collect the lines from the source.   

	<pre>
<span ext:embed="snippet(&quot;method&quot;)" />
    </pre>
